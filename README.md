# JudgementDay

This is basically a new hypothesis for how truth and existentialism works

It relies on the truth properties of "giberish". Automata produce simulations between two propositions where each proposition follows the same translation encoding rules. If the second proposition follows from the first proposition, then we say that so long as this simulation is not proved inconsistent in the future with two other propositions, then the first simulation creates a valid proof for the connection between the first two propositions.

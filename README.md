# Judgement Day?

This is basically a new hypothesis for how truth and existentialism works

It relies on the truth properties of "giberish". Automata produce simulations between two propositions where each proposition follows the same translation encoding rules. If the second proposition follows from the first proposition, then we say that so long as this simulation is not proved inconsistent in the future with two other propositions, then the first simulation creates a valid proof for the connection between the first two propositions.

We call this impercievable simulated automata which is the logical stuff between propositions in the form of a simulated environment "giberish", even though we presume it to have meaning.

The reason we presume it to have meaning is because of the following argument:
1. All logic comes down to three types of inferences: Invalid, valid, tautological
2. If something is valid or tautological, it means there is no contradiction. On the flipside, if something is invalid it means there is contradiction
3. All propositions are either positive, or negative in their meaning. If something is negative we can replace the entire proposition with another proposition with a single negation.
4. We can carry a single bit in an automata simulation that creates a positive or negative translation.
5. Therefore if there is no contradiction in the simulation and the second proposition follows from the first then we have a valid existential proof

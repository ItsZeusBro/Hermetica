# Judgement Day?

This is basically a new hypothesis for how truth and existentialism works

It relies on the truth properties of "giberish". Automata produce simulations between two propositions where each proposition follows the same translation encoding rules. If the second proposition follows from the first proposition, then we say that so long as this simulation is not proved inconsistent in the future with two other propositions, then the first simulation creates a valid proof for the connection between the first two propositions.

We call this impercievable simulated automata which is the logical stuff between propositions in the form of a simulated environment "giberish", even though we presume it to have meaning.

The reason we presume it to have meaning is because of the following argument:
1. All logic comes down to three types of inferences: Invalid, valid, tautological
2. If something is valid or tautological, it means there is no contradiction. On the flipside, if something is invalid it means there is contradiction
3. All propositions are either positive, or negative in their meaning. If something is negative we can replace the entire proposition with another proposition with a single negation.
4. We can carry a single bit in an automata simulation that creates a positive or negative translation.
5. Therefore if there is no contradiction in the simulation and the second proposition follows from the first then we have a valid existential proof

Interpretation:
There is a problem to merely conclude that one proposition follows from the other, simply by looking at this example. However, if this simulation and its rules worked for a bunch of propositions without ever contradicting itself in the simulation, then it is very likely that the simulation approaches real logic that is valid.

To build a robust logical simulation one should focus on a dictionary of propositions that never contradict anything else in the dictionary. If you can prove all propositions in the dictionary using a simulation, then you have a good logical simulation that approaches real universal logic

we also have to make sure that there is no possibility in the translation unit for any negation to exist outside of the negation cell. Or at the very least translate out any negations in the translation into another proposition with the negation cell!

As a part of the rule system, any proposition in the current state of the simulation that spells out a negation outside of the negation cell, should be translated to an equivalent statement. This does not violate the arbitrary rule principle. Rules can be arbitrarily selected without violating the existentialism of the system, so long as they are consistent.
